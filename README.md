A simple interface to quickly see and add third party repositories.

If you would like your repository added or removed feel free to message me or simply create a pull request.

Repositories should:
- Be maintained
- Contain mostly working plugins *for the international version*
- Not contain **any** plugins specifically designed to completely trivialize a major part of the game or disrupt the game to the point that SE would need to take action.
This includes poshacks, plugins designed to gain an advantage in PvP, automation*, etc. This is not intended to bring awareness to these types of plugins.

To clarify automation, it's fine as long as it does not automate multiple parts of the game or make intelligent decisions.
A plugin that moves you according to the mechanics of a fight would not be allowed,
but automating a craft repeatedly using a static series of commands defined by the user would be fine.
However, if it also automated going to the marketboard and put the crafted items up for sale or purchased more materials, it would not be allowed.

The last guideline will be decided on a case by case basis. If you want to dispute a decision then feel free to open an issue.
Alternatively, you can add another repomaster by using the wrench icon.

To install, add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnknownX7/DalamudPluginRepo/master/pluginmaster.json` under "Custom Plugin Repositories" in the "Experimental" tab of Dalamud's in game settings, and then install it through the plugin installer.

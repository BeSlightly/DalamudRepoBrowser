## Fork of DalamudRepoBrowser

This is a fork of the [original DalamudRepoBrowser plugin by UnknownX7](https://github.com/UnknownX7/DalamudRepoBrowser). It's updated to API13 and now uses Aetherfeed's config.json, which regenerates every 6 hours.

A simple interface to quickly see and add third party repositories. Utilizes [Aetherfeed's config.json](https://github.com/BeSlightly/Aetherfeed/blob/main/docs/config.json).

Also see [Aetherfeed](https://beslightly.github.io/Aetherfeed/).

For use with [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).
